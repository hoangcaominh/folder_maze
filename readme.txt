How to use:
- Run the .exe file
- Type the folder position (each folder has 10 folders and so on).
  First time run should be 0000000000.
  The mother folder is named 0, but do NOT change that name until the program finishes.
- If you have to close the program, just close it.
  Open the last folder in each folder until you meet the end of folder.
  Don't count the first 0, the last 10-digit number is the last position of folder the program created.
  Save that number in folder_position.txt (or something similar)
- If you want to rerun the program, first run it.
  Paste the position you saved in folder_position.txt (or something similar) and hit Enter.
  The program should continue to run from that position.
  The program is completed when there are 10 billion folders created.
